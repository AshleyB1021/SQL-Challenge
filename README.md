### SQL Challenge: Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis

## Overview

In this project, I analyzed employee data from the 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard. The data is provided in six CSV files, and my tasks included designing tables to hold the data, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and then performing various data analysis tasks

## Instructions

### Data Modeling: 
Inspect the CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables.

### Data Engineering: 
Create a table schema for each CSV file, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

### Data Analysis: Perform the following data analysis tasks using SQL queries:

* List employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee.
* List first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
* List managers of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
* List department number for each employee along with employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and last name begins with B.
* List each employee in the Sales department, including employee number, last name, and first name.
* List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* List frequency counts, in descending order, of all employee last names.
